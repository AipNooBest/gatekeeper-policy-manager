# v0.2

We are pleased to announce the release of Gatekeeper Policy Manager v0.2, changes in this new release:

- Improved layout of violations: now the violations of a Constraint are shown as a table instead of a list, this improves the readability when the count of violations is high. Also, we show a message now when there are no violations.
- Added missing "Scope" to the Constraints match criteria view.
- Show the line numbers in the rego code view ports.
- Added support for Gatekeeper "config" CRDs. Now you can view all the config CRDs as you would with the Constraints and Constraint Templates.
