# Unreleased version

## Changes from v0.3.0 to v0.4.0

A lot of maintenance and some bug-fixing on this release:

- Clicking on a violation gets "selected", this could be useful when there are several violations and you want to focus on just one.
- Show a message when violations for a Constraint are unknown instead of saying that there are no violations.
- Fixed double "Go back" button on logout message and better Info message style on Index when Authentication is enabled.
- Updated all Python dependencies to the latest version.
- A lot of work has been done to automate the SLC of the project (thanks @angelbarrera92!! ðŸŽ‰ ):
  - We have now automated E2E testing of the app against a Kubernetes cluster with Gatekeeper installed.
  - Automatic dependencies update PRs from renovate bot.
  - We have now an automated release notes generation
  - Automated linting and format check for all languages
