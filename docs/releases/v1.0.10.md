# GPM v1.0.10

Welcome to the release of Gatekeeper Policy Manager version 1.0.10 ðŸŽ‰

This is a maintenance and bug-fixing release including:

- [#976](https://github.com/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/pull/976) Fixed an issue in the Helm Chart preventing OIDC configuration discovery to work properly. Now optional OIDC configuration environment variables are set only when their respective values are set as chart values.
- [#981](https://github.com/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/pull/981) Fixed an issue that failed to recognise the selected context when its name contained special characters like colons or forward slashes, for example the name that EKS gives to the context by default. Now special characters are supported.
- [#982](https://github.com/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/pull/982) Improved the context selection drop down for long names, now the width is not hardcoded anymore and hovering with the mouse pointer shows a tooltip with the full context name.
- Bumped all JavaScript and Python dependencies to their latest compatible version
